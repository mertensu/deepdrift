# deepdrift

Note: The package is under development!

`deepdrift` is the R package accompanying the paper "Towards end-to-end likelihood-free inference with convolutional neural networks".

The package allows to download pretrained models and use them for predicting parameters from a few sequential sampling models.

Currently, there are three types of models available:

1. Leaky Competing Accumulator Model (LCA)
2. Drift diffusion model
3. LÃ©vy Flight Model
