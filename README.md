# deepdrift

NOTE: This package is under construction, please do not download!

`deepdrift` is the R package accompanying the papers:

1. _Towards end-to-end likelihood-free inference with convolutional neural networks._
2. _Learning the likelihood: Using DeepInference for the estimation of diffusion-model and Lévy Flight parameters._

The package allows to download pretrained models and use them for predicting parameters from a few sequential sampling models.

Currently, there are three types of models available:

1. Leaky Competing Accumulator Model (LCA)
2. Drift diffusion model
3. Lévy Flight Model
